Proof of concept of Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation for *de novo* transcriptome assembly.

[Spearmint](https://github.com/HIPS/Spearmint)
is used for this proof of concept as it was designed for object minimisation with as few runs as possible.

Using test transcriptome data from [Trinity](https://github.com/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq/blob/master/sample_data/)
and estimating assembly likelihoods using [RSEM-EVAL](http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/detonate/rsem-eval.html).
using the [RNAspades](http://spades.bioinf.spbau.ru/rnaspades0.1.1) assembler.
