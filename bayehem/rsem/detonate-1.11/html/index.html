<h1>DETONATE: DE novo TranscriptOme rNa-seq Assembly with or without the Truth
Evaluation</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>DETONATE (DE novo TranscriptOme rNa-seq Assembly with or without the Truth
Evaluation) consists of two component packages, RSEM-EVAL and REF-EVAL. Both
packages are mainly intended to be used to evaluate <i>de novo</i>
transcriptome assemblies, although REF-EVAL can be used to compare sets of any
kinds of genomic sequences.</p>

<p>RSEM-EVAL is a reference-free evaluation method based on a novel
probabilistic model that depends only on an assembly and the RNA-Seq reads used
for its construction. Unlike N50, RSEM-EVAL combines multiple factors,
including the compactness of an assembly and the support of the assembly from
the RNA-Seq data, into a single, statistically-principled evaluation score.
This score can be used to select a best assembler, optimize an assembler's
parameters, and guide new assembler design as an objective function. In
addition, for each contig within an assembly, RSEM-EVAL provides a score that
assesses how well that contig is supported by the RNA-Seq data and can be used
to filter unnecessary contigs.</p>

<p>REF-EVAL is a toolkit of reference-based measures, including contig,
nucleotide, and pair precision, recall, and F1 scores, a novel kmer compression
score, and several scores that compare induced kmer distributions between the
assembly and the reference. REF-EVAL also includes a program to estimate the
&ldquo;true&rdquo; assembly of a set of RNA-Seq reads, relative to a collection of
full-length reference transcripts. See <a href="ref-eval.html">here</a>, or
ref-eval/README in the distribution, for detailed information.</p>

<p>DETONATE is motivated and described in detail in the following paper:</p>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>The current version of DETONATE (1.11) is available here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="detonate-1.11.tar.gz">detonate-1.11.tar.gz</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As a convenience, we also provide a precompiled version, for Linux. This
precompiled version may or may not work for you; if it doesn't, please try to
compile the version above, instead.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="detonate-1.11-precompiled.tar.gz">detonate-1.11-precompiled.tar.gz</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Building/installation</h2>

<p>To build RSEM-EVAL and REF-EVAL, simply type &ldquo;make&rdquo; in the top-level
<tt>detonate-1.11</tt> directory, after you've upacked the tarball (<tt>tar
xvf detonate-1.11.tar.gz</tt>). If you have trouble with any of this, please
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/detonate-users">contact us</a>.</p>


<h2>Vignette</h2>

<p>A vignette with an extended example of the basic usage of DETONATE is
available <a href="vignette.html">here</a>, or in VIGNETTE in the
distribution.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>For information about using RSEM-EVAL, see <a href="rsem-eval.html">here</a>, or rsem-eval/README.md in the distribution.</p>

<p>For information about using REF-EVAL, see <a href="ref-eval.html">here</a>,
or ref-eval/README in the distribution.</p>

<p>For information about using REF-EVAL-ESTIMATE-TRUE-ASSEMBLY, see <a href="ref-eval-estimate-true-assembly.html">here</a>, or
ref-eval/README.REF-EVAL-ESTIMATE-TRUE-ASSEMBLY in the distribution.</p>


<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>RSEM-EVAL was coded by Bo Li, and REF-EVAL was coded by Nathanael Fillmore.
Bo, Nate, and Colin Dewey jointly developed the RSEM-EVAL and REF-EVAL
methodology, with feedback on the methodology from the other coauthors.</p>
