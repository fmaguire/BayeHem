The scripts in this directory compare the scores produced by the current
version of REF-EVAL to those produced for the DETONATE paper. Thus, this
directory's code functions as a regression test suite for the REF-EVAL code.

The steps below look numerous and complicated, but most of them either just
replicate the setup I already use day-to-day in the UW-Madison biostats pool,
or explain how to use the nfwq tool. In other words, using all the
infrastructure below might look like overkill, and indeed in some sense it is,
but it is actually pretty quick and dirty for me, given our existing
computational infrastructure setup.

To run these tests, do the following:

- Download http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/detonate/detonate_assemblies.tar.gz
  to ${workdir} and unpack it in ${workdir}. There will now exist a directory
  ${workdir}/detonate_assemblies.

- Download and install cctools (Cooperative Computing Tools) from
  http://www3.nd.edu/~ccl/software/. If you install cctools in a nonstandard
  directory, make sure that:

  - your PYTHONPATH environment variable contains something like
    ${ccdir}/lib/python3.3/site-packages/, and

  - your PATH environment variable contains ${ccdir}/bin,

  where ${ccdir} is the directory you installed cctools. While installing
  cctools, be sure to enable Python 3 support. For example:

  $ ./configure --with-python3-path $(dirname $(dirname $(which python3))) \
                --prefix $(pwd)/../cctools-install

- Download the nfwq package:

  $ git clone https://github.com/nfillmore/nfwq.git

  and add the nfwq directory to your PYTHONPATH and PATH environment variables.

- Create a DAG to run the tests:

  $ python3 make_dag.py --workdir ${workdir}

- Start a work queue master:

  $ nfwq start_master --db ${workdir}/dag.db --port 9140
  
  (It's best to do this in a GNU Screen session or similar.)

- In a different shell, instruct the master to look for available jobs:

  $ nfwq refresh_master --db ${workdir}/dag.db

- Start workers. In the UW-Madison biostats pool, the following will work well.
  Otherwise, look at this script and adapt it as appropriate.

  $ bash start_workers.sh $(uname -n) 9140

- After all jobs have completed, compare the results to those used in the
  DETONATE paper:

  $ python3 compare_results.py --workdir ${workdir}
