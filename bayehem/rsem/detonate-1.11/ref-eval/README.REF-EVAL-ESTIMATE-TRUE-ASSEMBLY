REF-EVAL-ESTIMATE-TRUE-ASSEMBLY: A program to estimate the "true" assembly
        of a set of reads, relative to a set of reference sequences

Overview

   This program constructs an estimate of the "true" assembly of a set
   of reads, relative to a set of reference sequences, based on
   alignment information produced by RSEM.

   As defined by DETONATE [1], the "true" assembly of a set of reads,
   relative to the true transcript sequences that the reads were
   generated from, is the set of contiguous subsequences of the
   transcript sequences that are covered by reads, with the reads
   overlapping by at least --min-overlap bases, when each read is
   aligned to its true location of origin.

   In practice, we do not know the reads' true locations of origin; in
   fact, we do not even know (precisely) the true transcript sequences
   that the reads were generated from. Instead, we start with a set of
   reference sequences (e.g., an Ensembl reference), and we align each
   read to these reference sequences using RSEM/Bowtie. The current
   program chooses a subset of these alignments, according to a policy
   specified by --alignment-policy and --min-alignment-prob, and then
   builds our best guess as to the "true" assembly based on these
   alignments.

Example usage

   First, use a recent version of RSEM to quantify the expression of the
   full-length transcripts relative to the reads. For example:

 $ rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.ensembl63.filtered.gtf mm9.fa ref
 $ rsem-calculate-expression --num-threads 24 reads.fq ref expr

   Second, use this program to estimate the "true" assembly:

 $ ./ref-eval-estimate-true-assembly --reference ref --expression expr --assembly cc

   This will output a file, cc_0.fa, that contains the "true" assembly.

Options that specify input and output

   --reference arg

           The prefix of the reference built by rsem-prepare-reference.
           Required.

   --expression arg

           The prefix of the expression built by
           rsem-calculate-expression. Required.

   --paired-end

           If you have paired-end data, and you want to estimate the
           "true" scaffolded assembly, then include the --paired-end
           flag. In this case, rsem-calculate-expression needs to have
           been run with the --paired-end flag. (However, even if
           rsem-calculate-expression was run with the --paired-end flag,
           you can omit it here in order to generate an unscaffolded
           assembly. In this case, each mate will be treated as an
           independent read.)

   --assembly arg

           A prefix to write the "true" assembly or sequence of
           assemblies to. The suffix _x.fa will be appended to this
           prefix, where x is the minimum overlap size. Required.

Options that change the output

   --min-overlap arg

           Either:

              * An integer that specifies how much overlap between two
                reads is required to merge two reads. For example, if
                --min-overlap=3, then only reads whose chosen alignments
                overlap by at least 3 bases will be joined into contigs.
                If --min-overlap=0, then only reads whose chosen
                alignments are contiguous (or overlap by a positive
                amount) will be joined into contigs.

           Or:

              * A pair of integers, separated by commas, specifying a
                range of overlap sizes, as described above. For example,
                if --min-overlap=2,4 is given, then three assemblies
                will be produced, corresponding to --min-overlap=2,
                --min-overlap=3, and --min-overlap=4 You might use this
                option to compute ideal assemblies at all overlap sizes,
                e.g., --min-overlap=0,76 for 76-length reads.

           Default: 0.

   --min-alignment-prob arg

           A number between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Any alignment (of a
           read to a reference transcript) with posterior probability,
           as calculated by RSEM, strictly less than this value will be
           discarded. Noise reads, with posterior probability exactly 0,
           are always discarded. Default: 0.

   --alignment-policy arg

           The policy used to choose which alignment(s) of each read to
           use in constructing the "true" assembly. Options:

              * sample: For each read, sample a single alignment (to
                some reference transcript) according to the posterior
                probability that the read follows each alignment, as
                calculated by RSEM.
              * best: For each read, choose the alignment that maximizes
                the posterior probability mentioned above. Ties are
                broken arbitrarily but deterministically (the first
                alignment in the BAM file is used).
              * all: For each read, use all its alignments. Some reads
                might end up with more than one alignment. In that case,
                contigs will be made assuming that the read aligns to
                each place. (In other words, the read is effectively
                duplicated, with one copy per alignment.)

           This policy is applied after the thresholding implied by
           --min-alignment-prob. For example, if
           "--min-alignment-prob=0.10 --alignment-policy=sample" is
           given, then (first) all alignments with posterior probability
           less than 0.10 will be discarded, and (second), for each
           read, an alignment will be sampled from among the remaining
           alignments, with the posterior distribution renormalized as
           appropriate. As another example, if
           "--min-alignment-prob=0.90 --alignment-policy=all" is given,
           then all alignments with posterior probability at least 0.90
           will be used.

           Default: sample.
